Network Design for Syahdan Campus - BINUS University

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive network design for the ground floor - 2nd floor Syahdan Campus of BINUS University. Each floor represented by individual LANs with connections established through routers and switches. The design integrates wired and wireless networks to ensure efficient data flow and security across the campus.

## Network Structure
Three distinct LANs, each representing a separate floor.
- Network Devices: Routers, Switches, PCs, and Access Points.
- Wired and wireless integration for robust network coverage.
- Security protocols implemented to ensure data integrity and secure transmission.

## Features
- Efficient traffic routing between the LANs.
- Wireless Access Points on each floor for seamless connectivity.
- Switch-based networking for high-speed data transfer.
- Centralized server management for enhanced data processing and storage.
